# EcoGPT

This Chrome extension is designed to reduce ChatGPT usage by promoting awareness of the environmental impact associated with AI models. The extension aims to help users make more conscious decisions about using AI-powered tools and reduce unnecessary usage, contributing to lowering the carbon footprint of these services.

## Features
**Usage Tracker**: Tracks the time spent interacting with ChatGPT and displays a usage summary.

**Environmental Impact Awareness**: Shows a message or alert when a user is about to interact with ChatGPT, informing them of the environmental impact of their actions.

**Alternative Suggestions**: When usage limits are approached, the extension suggests alternatives to ChatGPT for specific tasks, encouraging more eco-friendly choices such as Google search.
